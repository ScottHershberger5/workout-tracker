OOP workout tracking system

What is the purpose of the src/ directory structure?
# It keeps everything organized and easy to navigate and work with
Why do we use super().__init__() in the subclass?
# So we dont repeat constructors and have to rewrite code
How does inheritance help us avoid code duplication?
# Inheretance allows us to reuse code we already wrote from a parent class which saves us alot of time
What role do the tests play in guiding your implementation?
# These tests tell us if everything is working as intended and if one of them fails we know what specific part of our code is not working
Why do we work on a dev branch instead of directly on main?
# Because if we make mistakes then they are not apart of our main branch and so people looking at our code only see the working parts
