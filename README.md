# workout-tracker
OOP workout tracking system

This is a simple wourkout tracking application, with Three Exercise sub classes.
CardioExercise, StrengthExercise and FlexibilityExercise
We can keep track of our whole workut with our Workout class
We record, calories, duration, intensity, and length of exercise in out exercise classes

This program demonstrates the OOP concepts of testing, inheretance, composition as well as a good git layout, I used src layout for this project. The biggest takeaways from this assignment would be the testing and importing. The hardest part about the assignment would have to be the FlexibilityExercise class, it was the first time I really worked with raising exceptions. I had to think critically and look up some stuff to unstick me but I eventually understood it.
